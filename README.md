## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User uploads a bank statement PDF**
2. The app:
   - Tries to extract text using `pdf2json`
   - Falls back to OCR using `tesseract.js` if needed
3. Text is parsed to:
   - Extract **EMIs and loan info**
   - Detect **fraud patterns or anomalies**
4. Calculates a **credit score estimate**
5. Suggests **alternative banks and lower EMI options**
6. Saves the result to MongoDB and emails the user
7. Provides a **beautiful dashboard and PDF report**
